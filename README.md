# Starryy Stars (Spark AR Filter):
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Rise and Shine! Star is the Limit.

A simple and optimized glasses/specs filter, with floating stars in the background. The idea being to have a star studded life, just similar to the rising stars shown in the background. Having an animation sequence to change the spectacle design by taping on the eyes(three specs design included). A powerful and in-reality starry filter. Sample pictures taken through this filter are amazing in all surroundings, and tested throughout.

This is my first filter and SparkAR seems fun, many more to go. Thank you Facebook. Kudos to this powerful amazing technology with a very high reach and usecase.
